Invent 3 characters as might form an adventuring party in a fantasy novel or game. Avoid D&D specific terms. Avoid names that are common in fantasy literature or games. Use common fantasy races (similar to human, halfling, gnome, elf, dwarf, fae, orc, etc.). Write a bio for each including their names and fantasy race, and describe their appearances, personalities, role in the group (including their race), and how they feel about one other member of the group.
