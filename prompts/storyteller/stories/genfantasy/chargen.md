Create 3 unique characters forming an adventuring party for a fantasy novel or game. Avoid D&D-specific terms and names common in fantasy literature or games (e.g., no Gandalf, Elminster, or Drizzt). Use common fantasy races (e.g. human, halfling, gnome, elf, fae, orc, dwarf, or similar), ensuring each characterâ€™s race influences their culture, appearance, or personality in a distinct way.

For each character, provide:

* Their role in the group, including one specific skill or talent they contribute. At least one character should have a role that is not commonly associated with their race.
* Their fantasy race (add this to the description of their role).
* A creative name. Avoid repetitive name structures.
* Their appearance, incorporating at least one unique physical trait tied to their race or personal history.
* A personality that blends a familiar adventuring archetype with at least one unexpected quirk or flaw that makes them stand out.
* A brief description of their relationship with one other party member, highlighting a specific emotion or dynamic (e.g., admiration, rivalry, protectiveness) and a reason for it tied to their personality or past.

Ensure each character feels distinct in personality, appearance, and role, with no overlap in archetypes or racial backgrounds.
