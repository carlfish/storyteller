Invent 3 characters as might form an adventuring party in a fantasy novel or game. Avoid D&D specific terms, and names that are common in fantasy literature or games, but use common fantasy races. Write a bio for each including their names and fantasy race, and describe their appearances, personalities, role in the group, and how they feel about one other member of the group. Include their race in their role.
