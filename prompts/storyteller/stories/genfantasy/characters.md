# Seralyth Moondrift (Elf Priestess) 

Tall and regal, Seralyth moves like a candle flame in a silent room, her silver-blue robes embroidered with threads that catch the light. Her hair falls in a waterfall of pale gold, and her voice carries the calm of distant bells. A priestess of ancient waters, Seralyth serves as the group’s moral center and healer, offering quiet wisdom even when it’s unwanted. She feels a deep, almost sisterly protectiveness over Kressia, often masking her worry with cool, teasing remarks about her "excessive curiosity."

# Tamsen Korrick, Human Rogue 

Tamsen is lean and wiry, with a grin that looks like it knows every secret you wish it didn’t. His dark hair is perpetually tousled, and his clothes — practical and many-pocketed — blend into any crowd. Quick with a blade and quicker with a lie, Tamsen handles the group’s less "official" dealings, picking locks, pockets, and fights in equal measure. Though he pretends not to care, he listens keenly to Seralyth’s counsel, feeling both admiration and an awkward, growing guilt for the ways his choices could tarnish her light.

# Kressia Voon, Gnome Illusionist

Kressia, a diminutive gnome with vibrant purple curls and mischievous amber eyes, has a knack for turning heads with her patchwork cloak adorned with glowing trinkets. Her freckled face is quick to flash a disarming grin, masking her calculating intellect. As the group’s trickster and strategist, she weaves illusions and subtle charms to confuse foes or sway allies, her quick tongue often defusing conflicts before blades are drawn. Playful yet secretive, Kressia guards her past closely, which fuels her restless curiosity. She delights in Tamsen's carefree nature, often goading him into bets to test his willingness to take risks.
