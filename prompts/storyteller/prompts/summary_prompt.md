Combine the STORY SO FAR with CONTINUED to write a concise synopsis of the whole story, including the events in STORY SO FAR.  

# IMPORTANT: 

- DO NOT explain what you are doing or add commentary. 
- Be brief, just the facts, no excessive description.

# Instructions

Divide the synopsis into sections:

* WHAT HAPPENED - a chronological account of events, divided into scenes by location and time of day
* WHAT WE LEARNED - anything new we have learned about the characters, locations, notable objects, or other important elements of the story.
